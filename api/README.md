## Hasty Hooks

This'll be my submission to this year's Junction Miro challence. Don't look at the quality of the code too much, it's made under time constraint! ðŸ˜¬

It's fully functional if you add an .env file in the /api folder with your MIRO_TOKEN and MIRO_BOARD. Keep in mind, a real production version of this should use a properly sandboxed execution environment for the board scripts.
